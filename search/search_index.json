It covers both microeconomics and macroeconomics concepts.</p> <p>The course is built around the use of interactive micro-simulations (MicroSims) that students interact with to learn economic principles. For example, as students adjust the \"Price\" slider they can see how price changes alter the demand for a product.</p> <p>Our goal is to create many real-world scenarios showing how students can use economics principles in their daily lives. This includes helping students understand how personal finance strategies are impacted by concepts such as inflation and stock market volatility.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#why-this-class-is-important-for-high-school-students","title":"Why This Class Is Important for High School Students","text":"<p>Economics provides many ways to help students understand the world around them and become better critical thinkers. Although we study simple models, we also focus on helping students develop strong systems thinking skills and understand the role of statistics, data science, causality, psychology, and human behavior when building economic models. We draw on extensive case studies for both students who live in large cities and rural areas. A big part of this class helps students become better at detecting misinformation in social media and becoming skeptical about claims that are not backed up by a strong understanding of economic principles.</p> <p>One of the major weaknesses of prior economics textbooks is that they put too much focus on the creation and distribution of physical goods. In today's digital economy, we also focus on the distribution of electronic information products such as internet search and social networks, and the rules such as network effects that govern the winner-take-all economics of modern culture.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#target-audience","title":"Target Audience","text":"<p>The ideal audience is high school students who have completed an Algebra-1 course.

Welcome to the seller's perspective.</p> <p>This chapter is about supply\u2014how businesses decide what to produce, how much to make, and what prices to charge. Understanding supply completes your economic superpower. When you understand BOTH sides of every transaction, you can see through claims that only tell half the story.</p> <p>You've probably seen social media posts claiming that companies charge \"whatever they want\" or that profits are \"unfair.\" By the end of this chapter, you'll understand the actual economics behind pricing decisions. Spoiler: it's more complicated (and more interesting) than \"corporations are greedy.\"</p> <p>Ready to see the world from the producer's side?

A farmer might be willing to sell wheat at $10 per bushel, but if drought destroyed the crop, they're not able to supply it.</p> Demand (Buyers) Supply (Sellers) Quantity consumers want to buy Quantity producers want to sell At each price At each price Higher price \u2192 buy less Higher price \u2192 sell more Driven by utility (satisfaction) Driven by profit"},{"location":"chapters/03-supply-production/#the-law-of-supply-higher-prices-more-production","title":"The Law of Supply: Higher Prices = More Production","text":"<p>Here's the flip side of the law of demand: The Law of Supply states that, all else being equal, as the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied rises. As the price falls, the quantity supplied falls.</p> <p>In other words: higher prices \u2192 producers make more. Lower prices \u2192 producers make less.</p> <p>This makes intuitive sense:</p> <ul> <li>At higher prices, production becomes more profitable</li> <li>Higher profits attract new producers to the market</li> <li>Existing producers have incentive to expand</li> <li>At lower prices, some producers can't cover their costs and drop out</li> </ul> <p>Think about it from a producer's view. If you run a lemonade stand and lemonade suddenly sells for $10 per cup instead of $2, you'd want to make MORE lemonade, right? You'd work longer hours, buy more supplies, maybe hire help.
