## Concepts to Cover (11 total)

From the learning graph, in dependency order:

| Concept | Dependencies | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Market Structure | Market, Equilibrium | Foundation concept - start here |
| Perfect Competition | Market Structure | Simplest market type - cover early |
| Price Taker | Perfect Competition | Direct consequence of competition |
| Monopoly | Market Structure, Perfect Competition | Contrast with competition |
| Natural Monopoly | Average Total Cost, Monopoly | Special case requiring economies of scale context |
| Price Maker | Monopoly | Contrast with price taker |
| Oligopoly | Market Structure, Monopoly | Few firms - strategic behavior |
| Monopolistic Competition | Market Structure, Perfect Competition, Monopoly | Hybrid model |
| Product Differentiation | Monopolistic Competition | Key feature that creates market power |
| Barriers to Entry | Monopoly, Oligopoly | What maintains market power |
| Market Power | Monopoly, Price Maker, Barriers to Entry | Capstone concept |

## Pedagogical Order Decision

**Order chosen:**
1. Market Structure (foundation/framework)
2. Perfect Competition (benchmark/ideal)
3. Price Taker (consequence of competition)
4. Monopoly (opposite extreme)
5. Price Maker (contrast with price taker)
6. Barriers to Entry (what creates/maintains monopoly power)
7. Natural Monopoly (special case with efficiency justification)
8. Oligopoly (middle ground with strategic behavior)
9. Monopolistic Competition (most common real-world type)
10. Product Differentiation (key strategy)
11. Market Power (capstone - ties everything together)

**Rationale:** Start with the ideal benchmark (perfect competition), move to the opposite extreme (monopoly), then fill in the spectrum between them. This creates a clear mental framework before introducing the nuanced "in-between" cases.

## Content and Style Decisions

### Tone Approach
- Use relatable high school examples (streaming services, fast food, phone plans)
- Include humor about real companies students know
- Empower students to "see through" marketing claims
- Connect to detecting misinformation: "When someone claims competition doesn't matter..."

### Real-World Examples to Use
- **Perfect Competition:** Farmers markets, commodity trading, online freelance work
- **Monopoly:** Local utilities, ISPs in rural areas, pharmaceutical patents
- **Oligopoly:** Cell phone carriers, airlines, streaming services, gaming consoles
- **Monopolistic Competition:** Fast food, coffee shops, clothing brands, streaming content

### Critical Thinking Angles
1. Why "competition is bad for you" claims from companies should be questioned
2. How to evaluate when monopolies might actually be efficient (natural monopolies)
3. Spotting when "product differentiation" is real vs. marketing fluff
4. Understanding why your phone plan is so confusing (oligopoly behavior)

## Non-Text Elements Planned

### MicroSims (3)
1. **Market Structure Spectrum Slider** - Drag to see how market characteristics change
   - Bloom Level: Understand (L2) - compare, classify
   - Shows number of firms, product type, pricing power, barriers

2. **Price Maker vs Price Taker Simulator** - Set prices in different market types
   - Bloom Level: Apply (L3) - demonstrate, use
   - Shows what happens when you try to raise prices in each market type

3. **Barriers to Entry Builder** - Stack different barriers and see market concentration result
   - Bloom Level: Analyze (L4) - examine, compare
   - Shows how different barriers create different market structures

### Charts (1)
1. **Market Structure Comparison Table** - Visual matrix of all four types
   - Static but rich comparison of characteristics

### Infographics (1)
1. **Real Companies Market Structure Map** - Where real companies fall on the spectrum
   - Interactive hover for company details

### Workflow Diagram (1)
1. **How Markets Become Less Competitive** - Barriers to entry flowchart
   - Shows paths from competition to concentration

## Word Count Target

- Aim for ~3,500-4,000 words of body content
- Similar length to Chapter 1 (roughly 680 lines)
- Approximately 6-8 minutes reading time for high school level

## Quality Checks

- [x] All 11 concepts covered and bold-defined
- [x] At least 5-6 non-text elements distributed throughout
- [x] No more than 3 paragraphs without a visual/interactive element
- [x] Critical thinking section connecting to misinformation
- [x] Positive, empowering conclusion
- [x] Consistent with Chapter 1 tone and format
