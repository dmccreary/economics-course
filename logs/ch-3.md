# Chapter 3 Content Generation Log

**Generated:** 2026-01-27
**Skill Version:** 0.03
**Chapter:** 03-supply-production

## Input Parameters

- **Reading Level:** Junior in High School (Grade 11)
- **Tone:** Light humorous with positive attitude
- **Theme:** Economics as superpower for understanding the world; critical thinking; detecting misinformation in social media
- **Log File:** logs/ch-3.md

## Content Decisions

### Reading Level Adaptations

- Target sentence length: 15-20 words (upper junior high to lower senior high)
- Vocabulary: Technical terms introduced gradually with clear definitions and relatable examples
- Explanations: Heavy use of real-world examples from students' daily lives (lemonade stands, food trucks, small businesses)
- Visual aids: Frequent non-text elements (every 2-3 paragraphs) to maintain engagement

### Pedagogical Ordering

The concepts list provides 18 concepts. Reorganizing for better pedagogical flow:

**Foundation concepts (first):**
1. Supply - the core concept, mirror of demand
2. Law of Supply - the fundamental principle
3. Supply Curve - visualizing the relationship

**Production and costs (building complexity):**
4. Production Function - how inputs become outputs
5. Marginal Product - the "one more worker" concept
6. Diminishing Returns - why productivity eventually falls
7. Fixed Costs - costs that don't change
8. Variable Costs - costs that change with output
9. Average Total Cost - the big picture of costs
10. Marginal Cost - the cost of one more unit

**Revenue and profit:**
11. Marginal Revenue - the revenue from one more unit
12. Profit Maximization - the MR = MC rule

**Shifts and changes:**
13. Change in Supply - movement vs shift distinction
14. Determinants of Supply - what causes shifts

**Efficiency (advanced):**
15. Economies of Scale - why bigger can be cheaper
16. Consumer Surplus - buyer benefit
17. Producer Surplus - seller benefit
18. Deadweight Loss - efficiency loss

### Tone Decisions

- Continue "superpower" framing from Chapters 1 and 2
- Use humor in examples (lemonade stands, pizza shops, streaming services)
- Include "Critical Thinking Challenge" sections
- Address social media misinformation about business pricing and "greedy corporations"
- Maintain positive, empowering attitude
- Connect to job opportunities and entrepreneurship

### Non-Text Element Decisions

Planned elements (type and rationale):

   - Bloom: Apply/demonstrate

2. **Production Function Worker MicroSim** (Understand L2)
   - Add workers to see output change
   - Demonstrates diminishing returns visually
   - Bloom: Understand/explain

3. **Cost Curves Chart** (Understand L2)
   - Shows relationship between MC, ATC, AVC
   - Interactive hover for explanations

4. **Fixed vs Variable Costs Table**
   - Simple markdown table comparing types
   - Quick reference for students

5. **Profit Maximization MicroSim** (Apply L3)
   - MR = MC demonstration
   - Students find optimal output level
   - Bloom: Apply/calculate

6. **Supply Shifters Cause-Effect Diagram** (Analyze L4)
   - Mirror of demand shifters from Chapter 2
   - Interactive diagram showing what shifts supply
   - Bloom: Analyze/differentiate

7. **Economies of Scale Infographic** (Understand L2)
   - Visual showing cost per unit declining
   - Real company examples
   - Bloom: Understand/explain

8. **Consumer and Producer Surplus MicroSim** (Understand L2)
   - Interactive graph showing surplus areas
   - Demonstrates deadweight loss when market disrupted
   - Bloom: Understand/interpret

### Critical Thinking Integration

- Section on "Why Do Prices Seem 'Unfair'?" - helps students understand producer costs
- "Misinformation Alert" callouts about "greedy corporations" narrative
- Challenge students to think about WHY businesses charge what they do
- Connection to entrepreneurship - "What would YOU charge?"

### Connection to Prior Knowledge

- Builds on Chapter 1 concepts: scarcity, marginal analysis, trade-offs, factors of production
- Builds on Chapter 2 concepts: demand curves, elasticity, marginal utility
- References the PPF when discussing production possibilities
- Contrasts supply with demand throughout

### Word Count Target

- Aiming for 4,500-5,500 words of main content
- 8+ non-text elements
- Balance of markdown lists/tables with interactive MicroSim specifications

## Implementation Notes

- All MicroSim specifications include detailed behavior and data visibility requirements
- Using kebab-case for MicroSim directory names (e.g., supply-curve-explorer)
- Each MicroSim includes Bloom taxonomy level and learning objective
- Responsive design specified for all visual elements
- Mirror structure of Chapter 2 where appropriate for consistency
