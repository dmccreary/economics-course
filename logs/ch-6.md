## Pedagogical Order Decision

**Order chosen:**
1. Market Failure (foundation - when markets don't work)
2. Externalities (first type of failure)
3. Negative Externality (concrete examples first)
4. Positive Externality (contrast)
5. Public Goods (second type of failure)
6. Free Rider Problem (why public goods fail)
7. Common Resources (third type of failure)
8. Tragedy of the Commons (why commons fail)
9. Property Rights (first solution approach)
10. Government Intervention (overview of solutions)
11. Taxes (basic tool)
12. Pigouvian Tax (specialized tool for externalities)
13. Subsidies (opposite approach)
14. Regulation (direct control)
15. Antitrust Policy (specific to market power)
16. Systems Thinking (connecting everything)
17. Correlation vs Causation (critical thinking)
18. Economic Misinformation (capstone - applying everything)

**Rationale:** Start with "why markets fail" (the problem), then explore three types of failure (externalities, public goods, common resources), then solutions (property rights, government tools), then cap with critical thinking skills that tie everything together.

## Content and Style Decisions

### Tone Approach
- Use relatable examples: pollution, social media, video games, vaccines, streaming
- Make externalities tangible with everyday scenarios
- Humor about "free riding" (we've all done it!)
- Empower students to spot faulty arguments about policy
- Strong emphasis on correlation vs causation (social media gold)

### Real-World Examples to Use
- **Negative Externalities:** Factory pollution, loud neighbors, secondhand smoke, traffic congestion
- **Positive Externalities:** Getting vaccinated protects others, education benefits society, maintaining your home raises neighbor's values
- **Public Goods:** National defense, street lights, fireworks displays, Wikipedia
- **Common Resources:** Ocean fish, public parks, clean air, free WiFi
- **Misinformation:** "X causes Y" claims without evidence, cherry-picked statistics

### Critical Thinking Angles (MAJOR FOCUS)
1. How to spot correlation-vs-causation errors in news and social media
2. Why "government bad" or "markets bad" are both oversimplifications
3. Understanding unintended consequences of policies
4. Systems thinking: how fixing one problem can create another
5. Evaluating claims about environmental policy, taxes, regulation

## Non-Text Elements Planned

### MicroSims (4)
1. **Externality Impact Visualizer** - See costs/benefits spreading to third parties
   - Bloom Level: Understand (L2) - explain, visualize
   - Shows how pollution or benefits spread beyond transaction

2. **Public Goods Contribution Game** - Experience the free rider problem
   - Bloom Level: Apply (L3) - demonstrate, experience
   - Interactive game showing why voluntary contributions fail

3. **Tragedy of the Commons Simulator** - Fish a shared lake, watch it deplete
   - Bloom Level: Analyze (L4) - examine patterns
   - Classic simulation showing overuse dynamics

4. **Correlation vs Causation Detector** - Evaluate claims and find the flaw
   - Bloom Level: Evaluate (L5) - judge, critique
   - Practice spotting spurious correlations

### Charts (1)
1. **Market Failure Types Matrix** - Compare characteristics of each type

### Infographics (1)
1. **Government Policy Toolkit** - Overview of intervention options with trade-offs

### Workflow Diagram (1)
1. **Systems Thinking Feedback Loop** - How policies create ripple effects

## Word Count Target

- Aim for ~4,500-5,000 words (slightly longer due to 18 concepts)
- Approximately 9-11 minutes reading time for high school level

## Special Notes

This chapter is PERFECT for the user's goals around critical thinking and misinformation detection. The final three concepts (Systems Thinking, Correlation vs Causation, Economic Misinformation) directly address social media literacy and should be given substantial treatment as a capstone section.
