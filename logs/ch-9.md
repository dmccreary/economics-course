# Chapter 9: Inflation and the Business Cycle - Content Generation Log

**Generated:** 2026-01-27
**Skill Version:** 0.03
**Reading Level:** Junior in High School (Grade 11)

## Content Decisions

### Tone and Style
- **Light humorous tone with positive attitude** as requested
- Continue the "economics as superpower" theme
- Make inflation personally relevant - students experience price changes
- Include critical thinking about inflation statistics manipulation
- Connect inflation to purchasing power (real vs nominal thinking from Ch 7)
- Address inflation fears without being alarmist

### Concept Organization Strategy

The chapter covers 7 concepts. Organizing in pedagogical order:

1. **Foundation concepts first:**
   - Inflation (what it is, why it happens)
   - Consumer Price Index (how we measure price changes)
   - Inflation Rate (the calculation)

2. **Effects and variations:**
   - Purchasing Power (what inflation does to your money)
   - Deflation (the opposite problem - actually worse!)

3. **Economic cycles:**
   - Recession (connecting to business cycle from Ch 7)
   - Stagflation (the worst-case scenario)

### Non-Text Elements Plan

**Interactive MicroSims:**
1. **CPI Market Basket** - Build a basket, see how price changes affect the index (Understand level)
2. **Inflation Calculator** - See how money loses purchasing power over time (Apply level)
3. **Purchasing Power Time Machine** - Compare what $100 bought in different decades (Understand level)

**Infographics:**
1. **What's in the CPI Basket?** - Visual breakdown of spending categories
2. **Types of Inflation** - Demand-pull vs cost-push causes

**Charts:**
1. **Historical Inflation Rates** - US data showing high inflation periods
2. **Purchasing Power Decline** - How $1 has lost value over time

**Tables:**
1. **CPI Categories and Weights** - What's included and how much it matters
2. **Inflation Winners and Losers** - Who benefits, who suffers
3. **Recession Indicators** - Warning signs economists watch

### Critical Thinking Focus Areas

1. **"Shrinkflation" awareness** - Same price, smaller package = hidden inflation
2. **Core vs headline inflation** - Why food and energy are excluded
3. **Personal inflation rate** - CPI may not match your experience
4. **Inflation fears vs reality** - Media often exaggerates
5. **Political manipulation** - How different groups spin inflation data
6. **Hyperinflation examples** - When things go really wrong (Venezuela, Zimbabwe)

### MicroSim Specifications

**1. CPI Market Basket Builder**
- Bloom Level: Understand (L2)
- Students adjust prices in a basket and see CPI change
- Shows how different items have different weights
- Reveals why your personal inflation might differ from official CPI

**2. Inflation Impact Calculator**
- Bloom Level: Apply (L3)
- Input: Amount, years, inflation rate
- Output: Real purchasing power over time
- Visualize how savings erode without growth

**3. Purchasing Power Time Machine**
- Bloom Level: Understand (L2)
- See what $100 could buy in 1970, 1990, 2010, today
- Specific items: movie tickets, gas, minimum wage hours needed
- Makes abstract "purchasing power" concrete

### Content Length Target

Approximately 3,500-4,000 words of main content (matching previous chapters)

### Special Notes

- Students hear about inflation constantly in news but may not understand mechanics
- Connect to their experience: gas prices, food prices, streaming subscriptions
- Shrinkflation is perfect relatable example - smaller candy bars!
- Deflation section should explain why falling prices aren't always good
- Stagflation is tricky - use 1970s oil crisis as concrete example
- Recession content can reference COVID for recent memory
- Avoid political bias when discussing causes/responses
