# Chapter 2 Content Generation Log

**Generated:** 2026-01-27
**Skill Version:** 0.03
**Chapter:** 02-demand-consumer-behavior

## Input Parameters

- **Reading Level:** Junior in High School (Grade 11)
- **Tone:** Light humorous with positive attitude
- **Theme:** Economics as superpower for understanding the world; critical thinking; detecting misinformation in social media
- **Log File:** logs/ch-2.md

## Content Decisions

### Reading Level Adaptations

- Target sentence length: 15-20 words (upper junior high to lower senior high)
- Vocabulary: Technical terms introduced gradually with clear definitions and relatable examples
- Explanations: Heavy use of real-world examples from students' daily lives (shopping, streaming services, coffee shops)
- Visual aids: Frequent non-text elements (every 2-3 paragraphs) to maintain engagement

### Pedagogical Ordering

The concepts list provides 18 concepts. Rather than following the exact order, I'm reorganizing for better pedagogical flow:

**Foundation concepts (first):**
1. Demand - the core concept, foundation for everything else
2. Law of Demand - the fundamental principle
3. Demand Curve - visualizing the relationship

**Building complexity:**
4. Utility - why people want things
5. Marginal Utility - the "one more" concept
6. Diminishing Marginal Utility - connects to why demand curves slope down
7. Consumer Choice - how people decide
8. Budget Constraint - the reality of limited resources

**Shifts and changes:**
9. Change in Demand - movement vs shift distinction
10. Determinants of Demand - what causes shifts
11. Normal Goods - income effect (positive)
12. Inferior Goods - income effect (negative)
13. Substitute Goods - cross-price effects
14. Complementary Goods - related goods

**Elasticity (advanced):**
15. Elasticity - responsiveness concept
16. Price Elasticity of Demand - measuring responsiveness
17. Elastic Demand - high responsiveness
18. Inelastic Demand - low responsiveness

### Tone Decisions

- Opening hook connects to Chapter 1's "superpower" framing
- Use humor in examples (streaming service price hikes, coffee addiction, pizza preferences)
- Include "Critical Thinking Challenge" sections to build skepticism skills
- Address social media misinformation about pricing and consumer behavior
- Maintain positive, empowering attitude - "you can understand this!"

### Non-Text Element Decisions

Planned elements (type and rationale):

1. **Demand Curve Interactive MicroSim** (Apply L3)
   - Students drag price up/down and see quantity demanded change
   - Visualizes the inverse relationship
   - Bloom: Apply/demonstrate

2. **Utility Satisfaction Meter Infographic** (Understand L2)
   - Shows diminishing satisfaction with each additional unit
   - Relatable pizza/ice cream example
   - Bloom: Understand/explain

3. **Demand Shifters Cause-Effect Diagram** (Analyze L4)
   - Interactive diagram showing what shifts demand left/right
   - Hover reveals explanations
   - Bloom: Analyze/differentiate

4. **Normal vs Inferior Goods Comparison Table**
   - Simple markdown table comparing behaviors
   - Quick reference for students

5. **Substitutes and Complements Network Graph** (Understand L2)
   - Shows relationships between related goods
   - Interactive hover for examples
   - Bloom: Understand/classify

6. **Consumer Choice Budget MicroSim** (Apply L3)
   - Students allocate limited budget between two goods
   - See trade-offs visually
   - Bloom: Apply/demonstrate

7. **Elasticity Calculator MicroSim** (Apply L3)
   - Input price changes, see quantity responses
   - Categorizes as elastic/inelastic
   - Bloom: Apply/calculate

8. **Elasticity Examples Classification Sorter** (Evaluate L5)
   - Students classify real-world goods as elastic/inelastic
   - Builds critical thinking about why
   - Bloom: Evaluate/classify

### Critical Thinking Integration

- Section on "Why Companies Study Your Demand" - helps students see how businesses use these concepts
- "Misinformation Alert" callouts for common misconceptions about pricing
- Challenge students to spot demand-side claims in social media
- Connection to influencer marketing and artificial demand creation

### Connection to Prior Knowledge

- Builds on Chapter 1 concepts: scarcity, opportunity cost, marginal analysis, trade-offs
- References the PPF concept when discussing budget constraints
- Reinforces incentives when discussing how prices affect behavior

### Word Count Target

- Aiming for 4,000-5,000 words of main content
- 8+ non-text elements
- Balance of markdown lists/tables with interactive MicroSim specifications

## Implementation Notes

- All MicroSim specifications include detailed behavior and data visibility requirements
- Using kebab-case for MicroSim directory names (e.g., demand-curve-explorer)
- Each MicroSim includes Bloom taxonomy level and learning objective
- Responsive design specified for all visual elements
