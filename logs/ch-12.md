# Chapter 12: International Trade and Globalization - Content Generation Log

**Generated:** 2026-01-27
**Skill Version:** 0.03
**Reading Level:** Junior in high school (Grade 11)
**Tone:** Light humorous with positive attitude
**Theme:** Economics as superpower for understanding the world, building critical thinking skills, detecting misinformation

## Content Decisions

### Pedagogical Ordering

The chapter lists 13 concepts. I'm reordering for better learning flow:

1. **International Trade** (foundation) - Why countries trade at all
2. **Exports** - What we sell to others
3. **Imports** - What we buy from others
4. **Trade Balance** - The difference between exports and imports
5. **Absolute Advantage** - The simpler concept first
6. **Comparative Advantage** - The more subtle but crucial concept
7. **Specialization** - How comparative advantage leads to specialization
8. **Free Trade** - The case for open markets
9. **Protectionism** - The case for trade barriers
10. **Tariffs** - The main protectionist tool
11. **Exchange Rates** - How currencies interact
12. **Currency Appreciation** - What happens when currency values change
13. **Globalization** - The big picture synthesis

### Tone and Style Decisions

- Use relatable examples students encounter daily (phones, clothes, food)
- Frame trade knowledge as protection against political manipulation
- Include humor about trade debates (everyone claims to be "pro-worker")
- Emphasize that trade creates winners AND losers - both matter
- Connect to current events students might hear about (trade wars, tariffs)
- Acknowledge complexity without taking political sides

### MicroSim Decisions

1. **Trade Balance Tracker** (Understand, L2) - Visualize US trade flows with major partners
   - Rationale: Concrete data helps students understand abstract "trade deficit" concept
   - Shows where everyday products come from

2. **Comparative Advantage Calculator** (Apply, L3) - Interactive example showing why trade helps both parties
   - Rationale: This concept is counterintuitive and needs hands-on exploration
   - Use relatable example (two friends trading chores/homework help)

3. **Tariff Impact Simulator** (Analyze, L4) - See who pays for tariffs
   - Rationale: Huge misinformation about tariffs ("other countries pay")
   - Shows effects on prices, consumers, domestic producers, foreign producers

4. **Exchange Rate Explorer** (Apply, L3) - See how currency changes affect trade
   - Rationale: Currency is abstract; visualization helps
   - Shows why weak/strong dollar affects different groups differently

5. **Trade Debate Analyzer** (Evaluate, L5) - Evaluate common trade arguments
   - Rationale: Trade debates are full of misleading claims
   - Practice identifying who benefits from which policies

6. **Globalization Winners & Losers** (Analyze, L4) - See distributional effects
   - Rationale: Shows why people disagree about trade even when it "helps overall"
   - Builds empathy for different perspectives

### Content Structure

1. **Hook:** Start with everything in their room that came from other countries
2. **Foundation:** Why trade exists (mutual benefit)
3. **Core theory:** Absolute vs comparative advantage (THE key insight)
4. **Policy debate:** Free trade vs protectionism (present both sides fairly)
5. **Mechanics:** Tariffs and exchange rates
6. **Big picture:** Globalization - benefits and challenges
7. **Critical thinking:** How to evaluate trade claims

### Tables Planned

1. Where everyday products come from
2. Absolute vs comparative advantage comparison
3. US top trading partners
4. Effects of tariffs on different groups
5. Strong vs weak currency effects
6. Arguments for and against free trade

### Key Analogies

- Comparative advantage: Even if you're better at everything, you should still trade
- Trade deficit: Not like a personal budget deficit (counterintuitive)
- Tariffs: A tax paid by domestic consumers, not foreign countries
- Exchange rates: Like prices for money itself

### Critical Thinking Opportunities

- "Trade deficits are bad" - Is this always true?
- "Tariffs make other countries pay" - Who actually pays?
- "Free trade destroys jobs" vs "Protectionism destroys jobs" - Both oversimplified
- "Buy American" - What does this even mean for complex supply chains?
- Understanding why factory workers and tech workers might have different views

### Connection to Prior Chapters

- **Chapter 1:** Scarcity, opportunity cost, specialization
- **Chapter 6:** Market failures, government intervention
- **Chapter 10:** Money, Federal Reserve, currency
- Builds on fundamental economic principles throughout

### Estimated Word Count

Target: 5,500-6,500 words (similar to previous chapters)

### Non-Text Elements Summary

- 8+ markdown lists (distributed throughout)
- 6 markdown tables (comparisons and data)
- 6 MicroSim specifications (detailed above)
- Multiple admonitions for tips, warnings, and critical thinking
- Collapsible questions for self-testing
