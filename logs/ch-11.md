## Content Decisions

### Pedagogical Ordering

The chapter list shows 12 concepts, but I'm reordering them for better learning flow:

1. **Fiscal Policy** (foundation) - Start with the big picture
2. **Government Spending** - One side of fiscal policy
3. **Taxation** - Other side of fiscal policy
4. **Budget Deficit** - What happens when spending > taxes
5. **National Debt** - Accumulated deficits over time
6. **Expansionary Fiscal Policy** - Using these tools to stimulate
7. **Contractionary Fiscal Policy** - Using these tools to slow down
8. **Monetary Policy** - Transition to Fed's toolkit (builds on Chapter 10)
9. **Expansionary Monetary Policy** - Fed's stimulus tools
10. **Contractionary Monetary Policy** - Fed's cooling tools
11. **Phillips Curve** - The famous trade-off
12. **Policy Trade-offs** - Synthesis and critical thinking

### Tone and Style Decisions

- Use conversational language appropriate for juniors
- Frame economics knowledge as a "superpower" consistently
- Include humor (references to pizza economics, etc.)
- Emphasize practical relevance to students' future lives
- Include "Critical Thinking Alert" callouts for misinformation detection
- Connect to current events students might see in news/social media

### MicroSim Decisions

1. **Government Budget Balancer** (Apply, L3) - Interactive slider to balance spending/taxes and see deficit impacts
   - Rationale: Hands-on experience with budget trade-offs makes abstract concepts concrete
   - Engages students in the politician's dilemma

2. **National Debt Timeline** (Understand, L2) - Historical visualization of US debt
   - Rationale: Context helps students evaluate debt claims they'll see in media
   - Shows debt in multiple ways (absolute, per capita, % of GDP)

3. **Fiscal Policy Impact Simulator** (Apply, L3) - See how fiscal policy ripples through economy
   - Rationale: Systems thinking visualization showing multiplier effects
   - Connects to real-world stimulus debates

4. **Policy Mix Dashboard** (Analyze, L4) - Compare fiscal and monetary policy effects
   - Rationale: Shows how both policies work together (or conflict)
   - Builds on Chapter 10's Fed content

5. **Phillips Curve Explorer** (Analyze, L4) - Visualize inflation-unemployment trade-off
   - Rationale: This is one of economics' most famous relationships
   - Shows both short-run and long-run versions

6. **Policy Debate Evaluator** (Evaluate, L5) - Analyze real policy arguments
   - Rationale: Direct application of critical thinking skills
   - Prepares students to evaluate political claims

### Content Structure

1. **Hook:** Start with relatable question about government spending
2. **Build foundation:** Fiscal policy basics (spending, taxes, deficits, debt)
3. **Connect to Chapter 10:** Show how monetary and fiscal policy interact
4. **Introduce trade-offs:** Phillips Curve and policy dilemmas
5. **Critical thinking focus:** How to evaluate policy claims in media
6. **Synthesis:** When to use which policy, real-world applications

### Tables Planned

1. Fiscal vs Monetary Policy comparison
2. Expansionary vs Contractionary policy tools
3. Winners and losers from different policies
4. Historical examples of policy responses
5. Phillips Curve data examples

### Key Analogies

- Government budget like family budget (but with important differences)
- Fiscal and monetary policy like gas pedal and brake
- National debt like a mortgage (contextualization)
- Policy lags like turning a large ship

### Critical Thinking Opportunities

- Debt ceiling debates: Separating politics from economics
- Stimulus check debates: Analyzing multiple perspectives
- "Government spending is always bad" myth
- "Deficits don't matter" myth
- Correlation vs causation in policy analysis
- Cherry-picking economic data

### Connection to Prior Chapters

- **Chapter 6:** Government intervention tools
- **Chapter 9:** Inflation, recession, business cycles
- **Chapter 10:** Federal Reserve, interest rates, monetary policy tools
- Builds directly on all prerequisite content

### Estimated Word Count

Target: 5,000-6,000 words (similar to previous chapters)

### Non-Text Elements Summary

- 6 markdown lists (distributed throughout)
- 5 markdown tables (comparisons and data)
- 6 MicroSim specifications (detailed above)
- 1 infographic (policy toolkit overview)
- Multiple admonitions for tips, warnings, and critical thinking
