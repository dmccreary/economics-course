## Scoring Breakdown

| Element | Max Points | Score | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|-------|
| **Title** | 5 | 5 | "Introduction to Economics" - clear and descriptive |
| **Target Audience** | 5 | 5 | High school students with Algebra-1 completion |
| **Prerequisites** | 5 | 5 | Clearly stated: No prior economics, Algebra-1 recommended |
| **Main Topics Covered** | 10 | 10 | 6 comprehensive topic areas with detailed subtopics (~45 topics) |
| **Topics Excluded** | 5 | 5 | Excellent - 5 categories of excluded advanced topics |
| **Learning Outcomes Header** | 5 | 5 | Clear "Students will be able to:" for each Bloom level |
| **Remember Level** | 10 | 10 | 6 specific outcomes (define, list, identify, recall, name, state) |
| **Understand Level** | 10 | 10 | 7 specific outcomes (explain, describe, summarize, interpret, paraphrase) |
| **Apply Level** | 10 | 10 | 7 specific outcomes (use, calculate, apply, compute, demonstrate) |

## Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Topic Coverage**: Six well-organized topic areas covering foundations, micro, macro, personal finance, digital economy, and critical thinking
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit list of topics NOT covered sets appropriate expectations
3. **Full Bloom's Taxonomy**: All six cognitive levels represented with multiple specific, measurable outcomes (42 total objectives)
4. **Modern Relevance**: Includes digital economy, network effects, and media literacy - often missing from traditional economics courses
5. **Practical Application**: Strong emphasis on personal finance and real-world decision-making
6. **Interactive Approach**: Built around MicroSims for hands-on learning

## Estimated Concept Count

Based on the course description, I can derive approximately **200-220 distinct concepts**:

- Foundations of Economics: ~25 concepts
- Microeconomics: ~50 concepts
- Macroeconomics: ~45 concepts
- Personal Finance: ~35 concepts
- Digital Economy: ~25 concepts
- Critical Thinking: ~20 concepts

This is well-aligned with similar introductory economics courses at the high school level.

## Recommendation

**Proceed with learning graph generation.** This course description exceeds the quality threshold (70+) and provides excellent material for generating a comprehensive learning graph.
