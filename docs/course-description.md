# Course Description

**Title:** Introduction to Economics
**Subtitle:** An Interactive Intelligent Textbook with Simulations

## Overview

This course provides an introduction to fundamental economic concepts and principles for high school students. It covers both microeconomics and macroeconomics concepts.

The course is built around the use of interactive micro-simulations (MicroSims) that students interact with to learn economic principles. For example, as students adjust the "Price" slider they can see how price changes alter the demand for a product.

Our goal is to create many real-world scenarios showing how students can use economics principles in their daily lives. This includes helping students understand how personal finance strategies are impacted by concepts such as inflation and stock market volatility.

## Why This Class Is Important for High School Students

Economics provides many ways to help students understand the world around them and become better critical thinkers. Although we study simple models, we also focus on helping students develop strong systems thinking skills and understand the role of statistics, data science, causality, psychology, and human behavior when building economic models. We draw on extensive case studies for both students who live in large cities and rural areas. A big part of this class helps students become better at detecting misinformation in social media and becoming skeptical about claims that are not backed up by a strong understanding of economic principles.

One of the major weaknesses of prior economics textbooks is that they put too much focus on the creation and distribution of physical goods. In today's digital economy, we also focus on the distribution of electronic information products such as internet search and social networks, and the rules such as network effects that govern the winner-take-all economics of modern culture.

## Target Audience

The ideal audience is high school students who have completed an Algebra-1 course. Although we don't depend heavily on complex mathematics, we have many optional learning paths for students to apply algebra and pre-calculus topics. There are even some optional examples that use basic calculus for advanced students.

## Prerequisites

No prior economics knowledge required. Algebra-1 completion recommended.
