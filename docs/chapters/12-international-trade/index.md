## Your Phone Is a World Traveler

Take out your smartphone. (Or just think about it if your teacher doesn't allow phones in class.)

That little device in your pocket has been around the world—literally. The rare earth minerals might come from China or the Congo. The screen glass could be from Japan. The processor was probably designed in the United States but manufactured in Taiwan. The battery might have components from South Korea. Final assembly? Probably China or Vietnam. And then it traveled to wherever you bought it.

Your phone is a product of **international trade**—the economic superpower that lets you hold technology from dozens of countries in your hand for a price most people can afford.

But here's where it gets interesting (and political): Should we trade this much with other countries? Are we "losing" when we buy things from abroad? Should the government make it more expensive to import things? Every election, you'll hear arguments about trade—and most of them are misleading, oversimplified, or outright wrong.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have the knowledge to evaluate trade claims for yourself. You'll understand why economists mostly agree that trade is beneficial, why many workers feel left behind, and why the "obvious" solutions usually aren't as obvious as they seem.

Let's explore the global economy.

## What Is International Trade?

**International trade** is the exchange of goods, services, and capital across international borders.

It's simply buying and selling between countries. When an American company sells software to Germany, that's trade. When you buy a shirt made in Bangladesh, that's trade. When a Japanese company invests in a factory in Mexico, that's trade in capital.

Trade happens because it benefits both sides—otherwise, people wouldn't do it. But the benefits aren't distributed equally, which is why trade is so politically contentious.

### Why Do Countries Trade?

Countries trade for several reasons:

- **Resource differences**: Saudi Arabia has oil; Japan doesn't. Brazil has coffee beans; Canada doesn't. Trade lets countries access resources they lack.

- **Climate and geography**: You can't grow bananas in Minnesota (not economically, anyway). Trade lets people everywhere enjoy products from everywhere.

- **Skill and technology differences**: Some countries have developed expertise in certain industries. Germany makes great cars. Switzerland makes great watches. South Korea makes great electronics.

- **Cost differences**: Labor costs vary dramatically. A worker in Vietnam might earn $300/month; a similar worker in the US might earn $3,000/month. This affects where things get made.

- **Economies of scale**: It's cheaper to make 10 million phones in one giant factory than 1 million phones in 10 small factories. Trade lets companies reach huge markets.

| Reason for Trade | Example |
|-----------------|---------|
| Resource differences | Oil from Middle East, rare earths from China |
| Climate/geography | Coffee from Colombia, salmon from Norway |
| Expertise | Luxury goods from France, machinery from Germany |
| Cost differences | Clothing from Bangladesh, electronics assembly in China |
| Economies of scale | Aircraft from Boeing/Airbus, chips from TSMC |

## Exports and Imports

Let's define the basic terms.

**Exports** are goods and services produced domestically and sold to other countries.

When Boeing sells airplanes to Singapore Airlines, those planes are US exports. When Hollywood studios license movies to international theaters, those are US service exports. When American universities attract foreign students, that's technically an export of educational services.

**Imports** are goods and services produced in other countries and purchased domestically.

When you buy a Toyota made in Japan, that's a US import. When you subscribe to a video game made by a Japanese company, that's a service import. When American tourists spend money in Paris, that's importing French tourism services.

### What Does the US Trade?

The US is both a major exporter and a major importer. Here's what we trade:

**Top US Exports:**
- Refined petroleum products
- Aircraft and aircraft parts
- Pharmaceuticals
- Medical instruments
- Semiconductors and electronics
- Agricultural products (soybeans, corn, wheat)
- Financial and business services

**Top US Imports:**
- Consumer electronics (phones, computers, TVs)
- Vehicles and auto parts
- Crude oil
- Pharmaceuticals
- Clothing and apparel
- Furniture and household goods
- Machinery

Notice something interesting: We both export AND import many of the same categories (like pharmaceuticals and vehicles). This is called **intra-industry trade**—trading similar products back and forth. Why? Because consumers want variety. Americans might buy German cars while Germans buy American cars. Both countries benefit from more choices.

## Trade Balance: Deficits and Surpluses

The **trade balance** is the difference between a country's exports and imports over a period of time.

$$\text{Trade Balance} = \text{Exports} - \text{Imports}$$

If exports exceed imports, you have a **trade surplus**. If imports exceed exports, you have a **trade deficit**.

The US has run a trade deficit for decades. In 2024, we imported roughly $400 billion more than we exported. Is this a problem?

### The Trade Deficit Myth

Here's where your critical thinking superpower kicks in. You'll often hear:

> "The trade deficit means we're losing! Other countries are taking advantage of us!"

This framing is deeply misleading. Here's why:

**A trade deficit isn't like a household budget deficit.** When you run a household deficit, you're spending more than you earn—that's unsustainable. But a trade deficit just means you're buying more from other countries than you're selling to them.

**A trade deficit means people want to sell to you.** Other countries accept US dollars for their goods because they want our dollars. They use those dollars to invest in America (buying US stocks, bonds, real estate, or companies). A trade deficit is automatically offset by a **capital account surplus**—foreign investment flowing in.

**Trade deficits often increase during good economic times.** When the US economy is booming, Americans have money to spend on imports. When the economy crashes, imports fall and the trade deficit shrinks. Would you rather have a smaller deficit during a recession?

**The US has had a trade deficit for over 40 years.** During that time, the US economy has grown enormously. If trade deficits were so harmful, wouldn't we have noticed by now?

!!! warning "Critical Thinking Alert: Trade Deficit Claims"
    When politicians say "we're losing $X billion to trade deficits," ask:
    - Is buying things from other countries "losing"? (You're getting stuff!)
    - What happens to those dollars? (They come back as investment)
    - What's the alternative? (Buying more expensive domestic goods)
    - How has the economy performed despite decades of deficits?

## Absolute Advantage: Who's Better?

Now let's understand WHY countries trade. This requires two related but different concepts.

**Absolute advantage** exists when a country can produce a good using fewer resources than another country.

This is the intuitive concept: if the US can produce 100 tons of wheat with the same labor that Brazil uses to produce 50 tons, the US has an absolute advantage in wheat production.

If Brazil can produce 100 tons of coffee with the same labor that the US uses to produce 10 tons (those Minnesota coffee farms aren't going well), Brazil has an absolute advantage in coffee.

In this case, the logic is obvious:
- US should make wheat
- Brazil should make coffee
- They should trade

Both countries end up with more wheat AND more coffee than if they each tried to produce both.

### But Here's the Puzzle...

What if one country is better at producing EVERYTHING? Should the superior country just make everything itself?

Surprisingly, no! This is where comparative advantage comes in—and it's one of the most important and counterintuitive ideas in economics.

## Comparative Advantage: The Magic of Trade

**Comparative advantage** exists when a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country.

This is the key insight: even if one country is better at everything, both countries still benefit from specializing and trading.

Let's use a simple example.

### The Lawyer and the Assistant

Imagine a brilliant lawyer who can:
- Do legal work: 10 cases per week
- Do administrative work: 50 documents per week

The lawyer is BETTER at both tasks than the assistant, who can:
- Do legal work: 0 cases per week (not qualified)
- Do administrative work: 40 documents per week

The lawyer has an **absolute advantage** in both tasks. Should the lawyer do everything?

No! Here's the key calculation:

**For the lawyer:**
- Opportunity cost of 1 case = 5 documents (50 ÷ 10)
- Opportunity cost of 1 document = 0.2 cases (10 ÷ 50)

**For the assistant:**
- Cannot do legal work
- Opportunity cost of documents = essentially zero

The lawyer's time is more valuable doing legal work. Every hour spent filing documents is an hour NOT spent on high-value legal cases. The lawyer should specialize in law and hire the assistant for administrative work—even though the lawyer could do that work faster.

### Between Countries

The same logic applies to countries. Let's say:

**United States** (per worker per day):
- Can produce 10 cars OR 5 tons of clothing

**Vietnam** (per worker per day):
- Can produce 2 cars OR 4 tons of clothing

The US has an absolute advantage in BOTH goods. But look at opportunity costs:

**US opportunity costs:**
- 1 car costs 0.5 tons of clothing (5 ÷ 10)
- 1 ton of clothing costs 2 cars (10 ÷ 5)

**Vietnam opportunity costs:**
- 1 car costs 2 tons of clothing (4 ÷ 2)
- 1 ton of clothing costs 0.5 cars (2 ÷ 4)

The US has a **comparative advantage** in cars (lower opportunity cost: 0.5 vs 2).
Vietnam has a **comparative advantage** in clothing (lower opportunity cost: 0.5 vs 2).

Even though the US is better at both, both countries benefit if:
- US specializes more in cars
- Vietnam specializes more in clothing
- They trade

| Country | Absolute Advantage | Comparative Advantage |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| United States | Both goods | Cars |
| Vietnam | Neither good | Clothing |

Instructional Rationale: Comparative advantage is the most important and most counterintuitive concept in trade economics. Hands-on calculation with visual PPFs makes the logic concrete.

Implementation: p5.js with interactive PPF curves, calculation display, and trade animation
</details>

## Specialization: Doing What You Do Best

**Specialization** occurs when economic actors (people, companies, or countries) focus their production on a limited range of goods or activities where they have an advantage.

Comparative advantage leads naturally to specialization. Countries produce more of what they're relatively good at and import what others are relatively good at.

### Benefits of Specialization

- **Higher productivity**: Practice makes perfect. Countries that specialize develop expertise.
- **Economies of scale**: Making lots of one thing is cheaper per unit than making small amounts of many things.
- **Innovation**: Focused industries develop new techniques and technologies.
- **More total output**: The world produces more total stuff when everyone specializes.

### The Catch: Vulnerability

But specialization has risks:

- **Dependence**: If you only make one thing, you're vulnerable to changes in demand
- **Supply chain fragility**: COVID showed what happens when global supply chains break
- **National security**: Should you depend on potential adversaries for critical goods?

This is why trade policy is genuinely complicated. The economic benefits of specialization are real, but so are the risks of dependence.

## Free Trade: The Case for Open Markets

**Free trade** is international trade without government-imposed barriers like tariffs, quotas, or regulations designed to restrict imports.

Most economists support relatively free trade. Here's why:

### Arguments for Free Trade

**1. Lower prices for consumers**
Without trade barriers, consumers can buy the cheapest products from anywhere in the world. This is like getting a raise without your employer doing anything.

**2. More variety and choice**
Want a Japanese car, French wine, and Colombian coffee? Free trade makes it possible.

**3. Higher overall economic growth**
Countries that trade more tend to grow faster. Trade spreads technology, ideas, and best practices.

**4. Comparative advantage realized**
Free trade lets countries specialize in what they're relatively best at, increasing total world output.

**5. Competition improves quality**
Domestic companies facing foreign competition must improve or fail. This benefits consumers.

### Who Benefits from Free Trade?

- **Consumers**: Lower prices, more choices
- **Export industries**: Access to world markets
- **Globally competitive companies**: Can source from anywhere
- **Countries overall**: Higher GDP growth

!!! tip "The Unseen Benefits"
    Trade benefits are often invisible. You don't notice the $50 you saved on a shirt because of cheap imports—you just buy the shirt. But those savings add up to thousands of dollars per year for typical families.

## Protectionism: The Case for Trade Barriers

**Protectionism** refers to government policies that restrict international trade to protect domestic industries from foreign competition.

Despite economists' general support for free trade, protectionism remains popular. Here's why:

### Arguments for Protectionism

**1. Protecting jobs**
When foreign competition threatens domestic industries, workers lose jobs. Those workers have families, communities, and votes.

**2. National security**
Should we depend on China for rare earth minerals needed for military equipment? Should we depend on foreign countries for pharmaceutical ingredients?

**3. Infant industries**
New industries might need protection from established foreign competitors until they can compete. (South Korea protected its car industry early on—now Hyundai and Kia compete globally.)

**4. Unfair foreign practices**
If other countries subsidize their industries or manipulate currency, "free trade" isn't actually fair.

**5. Environmental and labor standards**
Should we import from countries with no pollution controls or worker protections? Does that create a "race to the bottom"?

### Who Benefits from Protectionism?

- **Workers in protected industries**: Keep their jobs (at least short-term)
- **Domestic producers**: Higher prices, less competition
- **Communities dependent on protected industries**: Economic stability

### The Trade-off

Here's the honest picture:

| Free Trade | Protectionism |
|------------|---------------|
| Lower prices for consumers | Higher prices for consumers |
| More choices | Fewer choices |
| Some workers lose jobs to competition | Protected workers keep jobs |
| Overall economic gains | Overall economic losses |
| Benefits are spread widely | Benefits are concentrated |
| Costs are concentrated | Costs are spread widely |

The political asymmetry is crucial: The people who lose from free trade (factory workers whose plant closes) feel the pain intensely and know exactly who to blame. The people who gain (consumers paying slightly less for everything) barely notice and don't credit trade policy.

This is why protectionism is often popular even when economists say it's costly overall.

## Tariffs: The Main Tool of Protectionism

**Tariffs** are taxes on imported goods, designed to make foreign products more expensive and protect domestic producers.

When politicians talk about "getting tough on trade," they usually mean tariffs. Let's understand how they actually work.

### How Tariffs Work

1. Foreign company wants to sell product in US
2. Government imposes, say, 25% tariff
3. Importer must pay that tax when goods enter the country
4. Importer raises prices to cover the tariff cost
5. American consumers pay higher prices

### Who Actually Pays?

This is one of the most misunderstood aspects of trade. You'll hear:

> "We're making China pay billions in tariffs!"

This is misleading. Here's who actually pays:

**American consumers** pay higher prices for imported goods.

**American businesses** pay higher costs for imported inputs (parts, materials).

**American importers** pay the tariff directly to US Customs.

The foreign company might lower its price somewhat to stay competitive, but studies consistently show that most tariff costs are passed on to American buyers.

!!! warning "Critical Thinking Alert: 'Other Countries Pay Our Tariffs'"
    This is one of the most common pieces of trade misinformation. Tariffs are paid by domestic importers and ultimately by domestic consumers through higher prices. The foreign country doesn't write a check to the US Treasury. Always ask: Who physically pays the tax? (Answer: The US importer.) Who bears the cost through higher prices? (Answer: Mostly US consumers.)

### Tariff Effects

| Group | Effect of Tariffs |
|-------|-------------------|
| Domestic consumers | Pay higher prices |
| Domestic producers (protected industry) | Higher profits, more sales |
| Domestic producers (using imports as inputs) | Higher costs |
| Foreign producers | Lose some sales, might lower prices |
| Government | Collects tariff revenue |

</details>

### Other Trade Barriers

Tariffs aren't the only tool. Governments also use:

- **Quotas**: Limits on the quantity of imports
- **Subsidies**: Government support for domestic industries
- **Regulations**: Safety, environmental, or labeling rules that happen to exclude foreign products
- **Currency manipulation**: Keeping your currency artificially cheap to boost exports

## Exchange Rates: The Price of Money

**Exchange rates** are the prices at which one currency can be exchanged for another.

When you travel abroad, you need to exchange your dollars for local currency. The exchange rate tells you how much foreign currency you get per dollar.

As of 2024:
- $1 = approximately €0.92 (euros)
- $1 = approximately ¥150 (Japanese yen)
- $1 = approximately £0.79 (British pounds)
- $1 = approximately ₹83 (Indian rupees)

### How Exchange Rates Affect Trade

Exchange rates are crucial for international trade:

**When the dollar is STRONG (high value):**
- American tourists get more for their money abroad
- Imports become cheaper (you need fewer dollars to buy foreign goods)
- Exports become more expensive for foreigners (they need more of their currency to buy dollars)
- US exporters struggle; US consumers benefit

**When the dollar is WEAK (low value):**
- American tourists get less for their money abroad
- Imports become more expensive
- Exports become cheaper for foreigners
- US exporters benefit; US consumers pay more

| Dollar Strength | Imports | Exports | Tourism |
|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Strong dollar | Cheaper | Harder to sell | Great for Americans abroad |
| Weak dollar | More expensive | Easier to sell | Great for foreigners visiting US |

### Currency Appreciation and Depreciation

**Currency appreciation** occurs when a currency increases in value relative to other currencies—it can buy more foreign currency than before.

**Currency depreciation** occurs when a currency decreases in value relative to other currencies.

These changes happen constantly based on:

- Interest rate differences between countries
- Inflation differences
- Economic growth expectations
- Political stability
- Supply and demand in foreign exchange markets

### Who Wants a Strong Dollar? Who Wants a Weak Dollar?

This creates interesting political dynamics:

**Prefer STRONG dollar:**
- Consumers (cheaper imports)
- Companies buying foreign inputs
- Travelers going abroad
- Companies with foreign debts

**Prefer WEAK dollar:**
- Exporters (easier to sell abroad)
- Companies competing with imports
- Domestic tourism industry
- Workers in export industries

There's no "right" answer to whether a strong or weak dollar is better—it depends on who you are.

## Globalization: The Big Picture

**Globalization** is the increasing integration of economies around the world through trade, investment, information flows, and movement of people.

Globalization isn't new—the Silk Road connected Asia and Europe centuries ago. But it's accelerated dramatically since the 1980s due to:

- **Reduced trade barriers**: Countries lowered tariffs through agreements like WTO
- **Communication technology**: Internet, mobile phones, video conferencing
- **Transportation improvements**: Container shipping, air freight
- **Fall of communism**: China, Eastern Europe joined the global economy
- **Corporate strategy**: Companies built global supply chains

### The Good

Globalization has delivered remarkable benefits:

- **Lifted billions out of poverty**: China, India, and other developing countries have seen massive poverty reduction
- **Lower prices**: Global competition drives prices down
- **More choices**: Access to products from around the world
- **Spread of technology**: Ideas and innovations flow globally
- **Economic growth**: Countries that engage with the world tend to grow faster

### The Bad

But globalization has also caused real pain:

- **Job losses in developed countries**: Manufacturing moved to lower-wage countries
- **Community devastation**: When a factory closes, the whole town suffers
- **Wage pressure**: Competition from low-wage workers abroad holds down wages for some
- **Environmental concerns**: Production moves to countries with lax regulations
- **Cultural homogenization**: Local businesses and traditions displaced by global brands

### The Political Divide

Globalization creates a political divide that doesn't fit traditional left-right categories:

**Pro-globalization coalition:**
- Economists (mostly)
- Multinational corporations
- Consumers who value low prices
- Workers in export industries
- Developing country governments

**Skeptical of globalization:**
- Workers in industries facing import competition
- Communities hit by factory closures
- Small businesses competing with global giants
- Environmental and labor advocates
- Nationalist politicians (both left and right)

The divide isn't "good people vs. bad people." Both sides have legitimate concerns. The question is how to manage globalization's downsides while preserving its benefits.

- Increasing globalization:
  - Consumer: Benefits (lower prices, more choices)
  - Factory worker (US): Loses (job competition)
  - Tech executive: Benefits (global markets, cheap inputs)
  - Factory worker (Vietnam): Benefits (job creation)
  - Farmer: Mixed (export markets, but input costs)
  - Small business: Mixed (competition, but also opportunities)
- Aggregate indicator positive, but distribution uneven
- Time slider shows how impacts accumulated over decades

Key Insights:
- "Globalization creates more winners than losers—but the losers are hit hard"
- "The gains are spread thin (slightly lower prices), the losses are concentrated (factory closing)"
- "Both sides of the debate have valid points"
- "The question isn't 'is globalization good?' but 'how do we manage it?'"

Character Stories (on click):
- Ohio factory worker: "My plant closed in 2001. I was making $25/hour with benefits. Now I work two jobs for less."
- Consumer: "I don't really notice, but my family saves thousands a year on cheaper goods."
- Vietnam worker: "My parents were farmers earning almost nothing. I work in a factory now—it's hard, but I can support my family."

Instructional Rationale: Seeing globalization through multiple perspectives builds nuanced understanding and empathy. This prepares students to evaluate political arguments that often ignore one side or the other.

## Critical Thinking: Trade Debates

Let's apply your superpower to common trade arguments.

### Claim #1: "Trade deficits mean we're losing"

**Reality check:** A trade deficit means we're buying more than we're selling. Those dollars come back as investment. The US has had trade deficits for 40+ years while the economy has grown enormously.

**Better question:** What matters is whether the economy is growing and people are prospering, not whether one number is positive or negative.

### Claim #2: "Tariffs make other countries pay"

**Reality check:** Tariffs are taxes paid by domestic importers and passed to domestic consumers. Foreign companies might absorb some cost, but studies show most of the burden falls on Americans.

**Better question:** Who actually pays higher prices? (American consumers.) What do we get for those higher prices? (Protected jobs in some industries.)

### Claim #3: "Free trade is always good"

**Reality check:** Free trade increases total output, but the gains aren't distributed equally. Workers in industries that face import competition can suffer genuine harm—lost jobs, lower wages, devastated communities.

**Better question:** How do we capture the benefits of trade while helping those who are harmed?

### Claim #4: "Protectionism saves jobs"

**Reality check:** Protectionism saves jobs in protected industries, but at high cost. Those costs fall on consumers (higher prices) and on other industries (higher input costs, retaliation from trade partners).

**Better question:** What's the cost per job saved? Could we help affected workers more effectively in other ways?

### Claim #5: "We should make everything here"

**Reality check:** Making everything domestically would mean higher prices, less variety, and lower living standards. It would also hurt our export industries when other countries retaliate.

**Better question:** Which things should we make domestically (national security items)? Which things benefit from global supply chains?

??? question "Practice: Evaluating a Trade Argument"
    A politician says: "We're going to put a 50% tariff on all imports from Country X. This will bring back manufacturing jobs and make them pay for taking advantage of us!"

    What questions should you ask?

    You should ask:
    1. Who actually pays tariffs? (Domestic importers and consumers)
    2. What will happen to prices for consumers?
    3. What industries use imports from Country X as inputs? (They'll face higher costs)
    4. How will Country X respond? (Probably with retaliatory tariffs on our exports)
    5. How many jobs will this create vs. how many jobs in export industries might be lost?
    6. What's the cost per job created? (Often $100,000+ per year)
    7. Are there better ways to help workers in affected industries?

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Trade Argument Evaluator MicroSim</summary>
Type: microsim

Bloom Taxonomy Level: Evaluate (L5)
Bloom Verb: evaluate, critique, justify

Learning Objective: Students will evaluate common trade policy arguments and justify their assessments using economic reasoning.

Purpose: Practice applying critical thinking to real-world trade debates.

Canvas Layout:
- Main area (400px): Argument display and evaluation interface
- Right panel (250px): Checklist and feedback

Visual Elements:
- Argument card with trade claim
- Source indicator (politician, economist, activist)
- Red flag checklist items
- "Your Evaluation" selection
- Detailed analysis reveal
- Accuracy score tracker

Arguments to Evaluate:

1. "The trade deficit is killing our economy"
   - Red flags: Correlation ≠ causation, ignores capital account
   - Context: US economy has grown during 40 years of deficits

2. "Those tariffs will make China pay"
   - Red flags: Misunderstands who pays tariffs
   - Reality: American consumers and businesses pay

3. "Free trade has only helped the rich"
   - Red flags: Oversimplification, ignores consumer benefits
   - Reality: Benefits are real but unequally distributed

4. "We need tariffs to protect national security industries"
   - More nuanced: This can be legitimate for some industries
   - Question: Is this industry actually critical? Is protection the best approach?

5. "Trade agreements destroy sovereignty"
   - Red flags: Depends on the agreement
   - Reality: Countries voluntarily enter agreements and can exit

Interactive Controls:
- "Show Argument" button
- Evaluation options: "Accurate," "Misleading," "Needs Context," "Valid Concern"
- Red flag checkboxes
- "Reveal Analysis" button
- Difficulty selector

Behavior:
- Present argument with source
- Student selects red flags and evaluation
- Detailed analysis compares to student answer
- Explain what's right and wrong about the argument
- Track performance across arguments

Instructional Rationale: Active practice evaluating real arguments builds lasting analytical skills. Trade debates are an excellent domain because they're politically charged and full of misleading claims.

## Key Takeaways

You've gained powerful trade analysis tools:

1. **International trade** is exchange across borders—it happens because both sides benefit
2. **Exports** are what we sell; **imports** are what we buy
3. **Trade balance** (exports minus imports) isn't automatically good or bad—context matters
4. **Absolute advantage** means being able to produce more with the same resources
5. **Comparative advantage** means having a lower opportunity cost—the key to understanding why trade benefits even "inferior" producers
6. **Specialization** increases total output when countries focus on their comparative advantages
7. **Free trade** generally increases economic growth and consumer welfare
8. **Protectionism** protects specific industries but imposes costs on consumers and other industries
9. **Tariffs** are taxes on imports—paid by domestic importers and consumers, not foreign countries
10. **Exchange rates** affect who benefits from trade—strong dollar helps consumers, weak dollar helps exporters
11. **Currency appreciation** makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive
12. **Globalization** has lifted billions out of poverty but has also caused real harm to some workers and communities
13. **Trade debates** require nuanced thinking—both sides have valid points
14. Always ask: **Who pays? Who benefits? What are the trade-offs?**

## Using Your New Superpower

The next time you hear a trade argument:

**Pause. Think. Question.**

- Who actually pays tariffs? (Not foreign countries)
- What's the cost per job protected?
- Who benefits from this policy? Who pays the costs?
- What would happen if we didn't trade at all?
- Is this a legitimate concern (national security, worker harm) or misleading framing?
- What do economists say, and why might people disagree with them?

Trade is one of the most misunderstood topics in public debate. Now you have the tools to see through the spin.
